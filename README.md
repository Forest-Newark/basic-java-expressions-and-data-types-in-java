# [Exercise] Expressions and Datatypes in Java

In this exercise we will do the following:

* Clone a Git repository into your Projects folder
* Open an existing project in IntelliJ
* Implement methods to print various expressions to the console
* Run tests

## Instructions

1. Start by opening a new Terminal session.

2. Change into your Projects directory using the `cd` command: 

	`cd ~/Projects`

3. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/tiy-raleigh-java/basic-java-expressions-and-data-types-in-java) using the `git clone` command: 

	`git clone git@github.com:tiy-raleigh-java/basic-java-expressions-and-data-types-in-java.git`

	This should create a new directory at `~/Projects/basic-java-expressions-and-data-types-in-java`.

4. Open this project in IntelliJ

5. Find the `BasicExpressions` class, open it, and follow the instructions in the comments therein. 

6. When you're ready to run this code, select "Run All Tests (BasicExpressions)" in the drop down menu at the top of the screen and click the green Run button to the right.

7. If the tests pass, then you're done!
